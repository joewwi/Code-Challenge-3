# Flatdango
Flatdango is a website where you can view the available mvies in the theatre and buy a ticket. It comes in handy when you don't want to waste your money on transport:cool:.

## How to Run
To run the web page, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The page will load and display a list of movies along with their posters, titles, runtimes, showtimes, and available tickets.

To purchase a ticket, simply click the "Buy Ticket" button next to the desired movie. This will decrease the number of available tickets for the movie and disable the button if there are no more tickets available.


## Dependencies
The web page relies on the dependency:

- Bootstrap 4.6.2: A popular CSS framework for building responsive, mobile-first web pages.
